        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
            <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
            <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
            <li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
            <li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
            <li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li>  
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS will style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Internal CSS stylesheet is embedding an entire CSS stylesheet into a HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
          <li>a single change to the internal CSS stylesheet rule will apply to all tagged page elements</li>
          <li>External CSS stylesheet is the most common way of styling a webpage</li>
          <li>Allows developers to keep all their CSS files in a separate file making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Margin and padding properties often get confused.</li>
          <li> The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>In the preceding statement, a <link> element creates the connection to the external file</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles</li>
          <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
          <li>Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types</li>
          <li>'var': is variable</li>
          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword</li>
          <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>if statments will check whether a condition evaluates to be true or false, answer determins next course of action in a application</li>
          <li>we must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
          <li>must use another statement like 'if' to interumpt the control flow</li>
          <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.</li>

        <h2>Adding a File to Repo using Terminal</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In the command line, navigate to the prework-study-guide directory.</li>
          <li>Check what branch you are currently on by running git status</li>
          <li>If you are not on the main branch, run git checkout main to switch to the main branch.</li>
          <li>Pull the remote main branch into the local main branch by running git pull origin main. Now your local and remote main branches are in sync!</li>
          <li>Create a new feature branch for the JavaScript file by entering git checkout -b feature/add-js into the command line.</li>
          <li>Navigate to the assets/ folder in the project repo by entering cd assets in the command line. This is the same folder where we added the style.css file in the previous lesson.</li>
          <li>Create a new file inside the assets folder called script.js by entering touch script.js in the command line.</li>
          <li>In VS Code, open the prework-study-guide directory, and then open the script.js file</li>
